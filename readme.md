# Sentence Analysis Algorithm

## Description

This algorithm reads a sentence character by character until it encounters a period (`.`) at the end of the sentence. It determines the following:

1. The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
2. The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
3. The number of vowels in the sentence.
